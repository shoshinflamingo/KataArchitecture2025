## Shoshin Flamingo team:

* [Shoshin (初心)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin): The Zen term for `Beginner's mind` that includes openness,
  eagerness, and lack of preconceptions.
* **Flamingo 🦩**: the mascot of the company we work on: [LastMinute.com](https://www.es.lastminute.com/). While we are **not** an official team, we appreciate our [free Friday time for learning](https://technology.lastminute.com/tech-learning-and-development-friyay/).

And we are:
* [Pedro Grau](https://github.com/pedrograuminute)

# Business case:

## Cost breakdown

 ```mermaid
  pie showData
    title Where are the 800$ from each test going to?
    "Grading short answers": 150
    "Grading the use case": 400
    "Gross profit": 250
 ```

So, the grading leaves just a 31% gross margin that doesn't even include :

* Cloud infrastructure
* Software maintenance
* Test creation, analysis and updates
* Personal (HR, administration, etc)
* Office space, laptops, licenses, etc.
* Marketing costs
* Compliance costs
* Financial costs
* Taxes

There is a great opportunity to improve if we can reduce the grading manual effort by using AI.

## Risks

Finding 3000 architects for the not-so-exciting job of grading tests will be a tall order in this hard market[^1].
Some may ask for higher pay, and further inflation may reduce our margin even more.
Any change in the grading cost will have a leveraged effect on our neat margin.

But it is not only about money.
Growing from 300 to 3000 experts will be a human challenge that involves training,
culture, grading standards and supervision.

Also, our competitors will be trying to get a bigger piece of the pie,
and we will be competing to hire the same experts to grow in the same markets

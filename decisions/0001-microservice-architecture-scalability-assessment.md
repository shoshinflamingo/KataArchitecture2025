# Microservice Architecture Scalability Assessment

## Context and Problem Statement

Certifiable, Inc. is the market leader in software architect certification, with 120,000 certified professionals in its database. The demand for certified software architects is expected to grow significantly over the next four years, highlighting the importance of a scalable and maintainable system.

After analyzing the current microservice architecture and the estimated user growth, we found that the architecture is well distributed, with separate services and databases, ensuring scalability will not be a challenge. Additionally, the system does not require a high level of availability for most of its components, nor is a high level of concurrency expected.

## Decision Drivers (Why)

* The system architecture must support steady user growth without requiring major structural changes.
* The services and databases should remain independently scalable to maintain performance.
* High availability is not a strict requirement for most components.
* The expected concurrency levels do not justify over-engineering for extreme performance needs.

## Considered Options

* Maintain the current microservice architecture
* Introduce additional redundancy and availability strategies
* Migrate to a monolithic or hybrid architecture

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Maintain the current microservice architecture," because it effectively distributes services and databases, ensuring scalability without introducing unnecessary complexity. The current setup meets the projected growth requirements without excessive resource allocation.

## Consequences (Trade-Offs)

* Good, because the system is already designed for independent scalability and does not require immediate refactoring.
* Good, because maintaining the current architecture reduces operational overhead and unnecessary complexity.
* Bad, because components with lower availability requirements may not be optimized for rapid failover, though this is not a critical concern.
* Bad, because in the unlikely event of significantly higher concurrency than anticipated, adjustments may be required to ensure optimal performance.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Maintain the current microservice architecture

* Good, because it aligns with the projected user growth without requiring major modifications.

* Good, because independent services and databases ensure efficient scaling.

* Neutral, because the systemâ€™s availability requirements do not mandate additional failover mechanisms.

* Bad, because unexpected spikes in concurrency may require future adjustments.

### Introduce additional redundancy and availability strategies

* Good, because it improves system resilience and uptime.

* Good, because it prepares the system for potential unexpected demand.

* Neutral, because it adds complexity that may not be necessary given current requirements.

* Bad, because it increases infrastructure costs and operational overhead.

### Migrate to a monolithic or hybrid architecture

* Good, because it simplifies service communication and reduces inter-service latencies.

* Good, because it can be easier to manage in cases of low concurrency.

* Neutral, because migration requires careful evaluation of trade-offs.

* Bad, because it reduces independent scalability and flexibility.

## More Information

This decision is based on the current user growth estimates and system architecture evaluation. It will be revisited periodically to ensure continued alignment with business and technical needs. If user growth or system demands significantly exceed projections, additional scaling strategies may be explored.

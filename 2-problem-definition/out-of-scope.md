# Not in scope:

We can anticipate a few needs in our new markets.
Those are out of the current scope, but we can keep them in mind in some of our trade-off analysis. 

## Multi-language:

Europe and Asia will probably require multi-language exams, grading and answers in their official languages.

## Country-specific tests:

Different countries may have different regulations or practices that require country-specific tests.

## Country-certified experts:

Local country test may require locally certified architects to evaluate.

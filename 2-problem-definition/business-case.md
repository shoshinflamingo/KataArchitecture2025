# Business case:

* Team
    * 300 Expert consultants
    * 5 designated experts
    * Charge around 50$ / hour (freelancers)
* Grading:
    * 3 hours for short questions
    * 8 hours for the use case
    * Charges 800$
    * 80% to pass
    * The exam will be consistent across countries (for the moment):
        * No need to translate the tests
        * No need to have country-specific tests
        * Each expert can grade tests from all countries
* Current market:
    * 120.000 certified software architects.
    * 80% market share
    * 200 Candidates per week in USA
* Expected growth:
    * Expected to grow 5â€“10 times + 21% grow over 4 years

## Cost breakdown

 ```mermaid
  pie showData
    title Where goes the 800$ from each test?
    "Grading short answers": 150
    "Grading the use case": 400
    "Gross profit": 250
 ```

So, the grading leaves just a 31% gross margin that doesn't include costs like:

* Cloud infrastructure
* Software maintenance
* Test creation and updates
* Personal (HR, administration, etc)
* Marketing costs
* Compliance costs
* Financial costs
* Taxes

## Risks

Finding 3000 architects for the not-so-exciting job of grading tests will be hard in this hard market[^1].
Some may ask for higher pay, and further inflation may reduce our margin even more.

Any change in the grading cost will have a leveraged effect on our neat margin.

Also,
our competitors will be trying to get a bigger piece of the pie
and we will be competing to hire the same experts and grow in the same markets

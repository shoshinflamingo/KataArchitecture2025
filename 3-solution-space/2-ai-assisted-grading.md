# AI assisted grading for the architecture use case

How can AI reduce our 8-hour average grading time?

### Automatically rating language clarity and correctness

LLMs text processing capabilities can rate our candidates ADRs and narrative style using clear,
objective criteria.
Our AI solution can select the most representative samples with problems and propose alternative phrasing.

It is good to automatize this because:

* Written communication is a key skill for architects
* Rating text is a repetitive boring task for architects who tend to prefer technical issues
* Candidates will try to provide clear, readable text that would also help with the grading problem.
* It is hard to rate English in a 100 % objetive way specially when there are 300 Software consultants involved. So the
  use of AI can improve the grading consistency and fairness.

### Do ADR, Architecture styles and architecture characteristics, make sense with the context?

Our good LLM can check the text against some solutions.
Given the limited number of cases (5) and possible styles or characteristics, we can easily have a good database of
responses for each case.

We can always add any original solutions to our database. 

### Automatically detect inconsistency issues

* Did the candidate use the architecture characteristics as drivers in the ADR design?

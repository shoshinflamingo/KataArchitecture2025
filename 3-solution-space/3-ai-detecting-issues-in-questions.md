# AI detecting issues in questions

AI is a cost-effective tool to detect unusual patterns from questions.

We could use unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms,
such as [Isolation Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_forest)
or [DBSCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) and push this info to our `Reports analyzers`.
This way they will focus more on the quality of our architecture test suite without the need to analyze patterns.

# Other ways to improve AI grading

## Allow reclaiming correction issues. 

We need fair, unbiased and precise grading, but we now that AI (and humans) are far from perfect.
So, we propose offering a mechanism to appeal any unfair correction.
This will not only become a feedback loop to improve the AI
but could also help to identify ambiguous or misleading questions.

## Beta test new questions as part of the exam training process

Any important test end up having a market for training.
We can offer training tests for third party academies and universities with new questions to beta test the 
automatic correction.
The trainers could manually review the automatic AI grading and provide feedback.
